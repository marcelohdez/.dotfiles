Wayland shill... using Fedora + Sway

## Setup

### _üöß‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏èüöß_

Use at your own risk! This is tailored to my setup and uses. I use **Fedora**.

---

First, clone this repo into its _permanent_ directory (otherwise symlinks will
break) and `cd` into it.

Then install the packages needed (at least, those available in the Fedora
repos):

```bash
sudo dnf install $(<packages.txt)
```

`pip` is one of the packages installed above, so you can install `autotiling`
through it (for automatic dwindle layout in Sway):

```bash
pip install autotiling
```

Then, [matugen], [hyprpicker], the [NerdFont] (symbols only),
[swaylock-effects], and [swww] must be installed manually (swaylock-effects'
copr is broken for me at the time of writing, inverting the screenshots and
other quirks).

Finally, run `./init.sh`. Assuming a clean install this should place config
files and scripts where they go (this will **not** override existing configs).

- **Tip**: You can install `xdg-user-dirs` to run `xdg-user-dirs-update`,
  creating the Downloads, Pictures, etc. folders for you and setting their
  `$XDG_*` environment variables.
- **Tip**: I noticed missing font problems in Firefox upon a Fedora Minimal
  install, and it seems that installing these additonal packages fixed it?
  `adobe-source-sans-pro-fonts gnu-free-sans-fonts google-noto-sans*`
- **Tip**: Wallpapers are put in `~/Wallpapers/<light|dark>`
