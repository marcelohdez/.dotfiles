### _üöß‚ö†Ô∏èWork in progress‚ö†Ô∏èüöß_

Use at your own risk! This is tailored to my setup and uses.

## Setup

_First, make sure you have all projects mentioned below installed!_

Then, `cd` into the root of this repo and run `./init.sh`. Finally,
let darkman run at least once to put all theme files in place.

**Wallpapers** are put in `~/Wallpapers/<variant>/`; (`<variant>`
can be _light_ or _dark_).
