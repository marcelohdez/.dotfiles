### _üöß‚ö†Ô∏èWork in progress‚ö†Ô∏èüöß_

## Setup
**First, make sure you have `stow` and any other projects/packages
mentioned below installed!**

Then, `cd` into the root of this repo and run `./init.sh`

**Wallpapers** are put in `~/.walls/<time>/<wallpaper_name>/`; (`<time>`
can be _night_ or _day_). In there is a `img.gif` file (the wallpaper)
and a `bar.css` file with a single color defined as _accent_ which
will be used by waybar's `style.css` to set the pill color. _To add
more wallpapers this structure must be used... or stuff will break._
