## Setup

### _üöß‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏èüöß_

Use at your own risk! This is tailored to my setup and uses on **Fedora**.

---

First, clone this repo into its _permanent_ directory (otherwise stuff will
break) and `cd` into it; then you can install the packages needed (at least,
those available in the Fedora repos):

```bash
sudo dnf install $(cat packages.txt)
```

You should now be able to switch to `zsh` and install `autotiling`:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
pip install autotiling
```

Firefox is used throughout this repo. You _can_ just install it regularly but
for the sandboxing and quicker updates I prefer the official Flatpak; then
creating a `firefox` script in e.g. `.local/bin/` containing:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox -- $@
```

Then, [hyprpicker], [NerdFont] (symbols only), [swaylock-effects], and [swww]
must be installed manually.

For theme files to be put in place, the `theme <light|dark>` command must be
run at least once, these dots also support [`darkman`] through the systemd
service.

Finally, run `./init.sh`. Assuming a clean install this should place config
files and scripts where they go (this will **not** override existing configs).

## Tips

- You can install `xdg-user-dirs` and run `xdg-user-dirs-update`, creating
  the Downloads, Pictures, etc. folders for you.
- I noticed missing font problems in Firefox after a Fedora Minimal
  install, installing these additonal packages helped:
  `adobe-source-sans-pro-fonts gnu-free-sans-fonts google-noto-sans*
unifont-fonts`
- You can symlink `foot` as `xdg-terminal-exec` so that glib apps (e.g.
  Thunar) open foot when needing a terminal:

  ```bash
  sudo ln -s /bin/foot /bin/xdg-terminal-exec
  ```

- Wallpapers are put in `~/Wallpapers/<light|dark>`
