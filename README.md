GNOME + Sway

## Setup

### _üöß‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏èüöß_

Use at your own risk! This is tailored to my setup and uses on **Fedora**.

---

First, clone this repo into its _permanent_ directory (otherwise stuff will
break) and `cd` into it; then you can install the packages needed (at least,
those available in the Fedora repos):

```bash
sudo dnf install --skip-unavailable $(cat packages.txt)
```

You should now be able to switch to `zsh`:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

I use the Chrome flatpak, to make this seamless I make a `chrome` script in
`/usr/local/bin/` with the following:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
flatpak run com.google.Chrome \
    --password-store=gnome-libsecret \
    --enable-features=TouchpadOverscrollHistoryNavigation "$@"
```

The `password-store` argument makes passwords stay even while in Sway, and the
other is for back/forward gestures on touch pads. Then, [dim], [NerdFont]
(symbols only), and [hyprpicker] must be installed manually.

Run `./init.sh`. Assuming a clean install this should place any files and
scripts where they go. You should log out and log back in to be in `zsh`.

You now have Sway on your display manager along with GNOME and all my app
configurations.

## Tips

- Install 'Night Theme Switcher', 'Color Picker' and 'Focus Changer' extensions
- To make printing life easier (out of GNOME), you may install `cups` and
  `system-config-printer` to graphically manage them. Additional drivers are
  available such as `gutenprint-cups` for e.g. Canon printers, see
  [Printer drivers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS#Printer_drivers)
- Wallpapers are put in `~/Wallpapers/<light|dark>/name.png`. See
  [the script](./localshare/both-modes.d/accent_color.sh).
