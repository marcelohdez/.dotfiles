### _üöß‚ö†Ô∏èWork in progress‚ö†Ô∏èüöß_

Use at your own risk! This is tailored to my setup and uses.

## Setup

**First, make sure you have `stow` and any other projects/packages
mentioned below installed!**

If `~/.config` and `~/.local/share/` have not been set up, the init
scripts fail, they can be made by getting `xdg-utils` and running
`xdg-user-dirs-update`.

Then, `cd` into the root of this repo and run `./init.sh`

**Wallpapers** are put in `~/.walls/<variant>/img/`; (`<variant>`
can be _light_ or _dark_). A `accent.css` file needs to be in the
`<variant>` folder with a single color defined as _accent_ which
will be used by waybar's `style.css` to set pill colors. _To
add more wallpapers this structure must be used... or stuff
will break._
